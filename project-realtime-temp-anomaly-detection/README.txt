Functional:
- Read real-time temperature measurements from Raspberry Pie
- Push data using KDS / KDF in CSV format to AWS
- Use KDA analytics to detectect anomalies
- Send SMS / EMAIL if anomaly detection
- Write data to S3 Buckeet - CSV + Anomaly yes / now
- Use GLUE to create schema
- Use SageMaker to train anaomaly detection
- Compare Comparison for Binary Classification SAgeMaker and Anomaly Detection with GT
Non-Functiona:
- Encryption in transit and at-rest
- Low latency to SMS receiving
- Lowest cost per 1h of operations



*CloudFormation Code to build AWS Backend for KDS / KDF  - Use

*Python Code to read Pie 
*Python Code to send reading to KDS
