In this project we build a system that is able to measure temperature indoors from multiple independent sensors spread around the house.  

1) Sensors that read temperature continusly and send the data over wirelessly - wifi/bluetooth over to a base station
2) Base station connects to the cloud and streams the recevied data to cloud storage
3) Web-based frontend that runs in the cloud allows users to view current temperature reading and 24h graphs
